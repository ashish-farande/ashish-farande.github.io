----------

I am a graduate student at UC San Diego, specializing in robotics and computer vision. I believe that we can solve majority of the problems in the real world by gather maximum information about the scene and currently images are the most efficient and informative way of collecting real world data. Hence, I enjoy working on 3D scene understanding.

Currently, I am working as a Robotics Intern at [Brain Corp](https://braincorp.com/), where I work on the development of shelf scanning robots. I have also worked as research assistant at [Statistical Visual Computing Lab](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/), where I worked on 3D Object Detection using Monocular Images.

Prior to my master's program, I worked as Senior Software Engineer at [BOSCH](https://www.bosch-softwaretechnologies.com/en/), where I developed features for car infotainment devices on a Linux platform using C++. My biggest accomplishment at BOSCH was -- redesigning a Middleware component with an emphasis on OOPs, which reduced the bugs by 80%.
